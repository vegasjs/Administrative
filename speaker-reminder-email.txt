This information will go on the event poster and will be shared with our meetup group.

Speaker tips:

- If you introduce a term or concept that might not be familiar to entry level JavaScript developers, please take some time to define it as part of your talk. If you'd like I can also give a beginner friendly explanation prior to your talk if you wish. Let me know!

- The resolution of your presentation on a projector will be lower than your computer screen, this may cause realignment of elements in the slide deck. The colors will also be more washed out.

- If you live code anything, prepare your computer to use a BIG EASY TO READ FONT

Let me know if you have any other questions. Thanks - Iâ€™m looking forward to your talks!
